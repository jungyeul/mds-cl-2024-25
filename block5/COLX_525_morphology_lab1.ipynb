    "Swahili is a Bantu language which is widely spoken in East Africa. It is estimated that there are 100-150 million Swahili speakers but not all of them are native speakers of Swahili. Swahili is the lingua franca of the African Great Lakes region. This means that Swahili serves a similar role to English in Europe and North America: non-native speakers use it as a common language of communication. Since Africa's economic impact and the Afican consumer market are growing continuously, Swahili is likely to become an important language for NLP in the future.\n",
