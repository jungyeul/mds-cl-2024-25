    "In this lab, you will implement and train a (distil)BERT model for Question and Answering on a subset of the [SQuAD v2.0](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset. Lab objectives include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the data to tensors using the BERT tokenizer\n",
    "2. Train a model for Question-Answering by tuning on top of a pre-trained BERT model \n",
    "3. Optimize the choice of start and end indicies\n",

    "We use distBERT in this lab because it is significantly smaller and faster than BERT, but with very similar performance. Even though we are using distBERT, we will call it BERT throughout this lab\n",

    "## Exercise 3: Discrete optimization of answer spans\n",
    "rubric={accuracy:3, efficiency:2, quality:1}\n",
    "\n",
    "The model from exercise 2 independently predicts both start and end indicies for the answer span. However, this is a case where there is a dependency between predictions that needs to be considered. In particular, it doesn't make sense to have the end index appear before the start index, or too long after it. You want to pick the highest probability pair that satisfies those basic constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will enforce these constraints using discrete optimization. You will write a function `select_best_answer_span` which takes a two numpy matrices of equal size; each row of the first matrix corresponds to the log probabilities for start prediction, and each row of the second matrix is the corresponding log probabilties for the end prediction (i.e. these are the `start_logits` and `end_logits` from above, appropriately logsoftmaxed). The third argument to the function is an integer `distance` which indicates how soon after the start token the end token must appear (i.e. distance = 0 indicates that start and end must be the same token).\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is provided in the form of `select_best_answer_span_slow`. It solves this problem but it does so in a slow, fairly brute force way. You need to implement a better version. You have two choices: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each row of start/end probabilities provided, set up a PuLP problem (see Lecture 7 of DSCI 512). Your variable dict for each problem should consist of only two rows, with as many columns as you have tokens in your input. The first row corresponds to the choice of the start index, the second corresponds to the choice of end index. You'll need to constrain there to be only one 1 per row (i.e. only one index can be assigned for each start/end). The other set of constraints are trickier: one way to formulate things is that, for each possible index, the (single) corresponding element of the start row minus all the elements of the end row which are ends for that start should be less than zero; this means you can't have an index at a particular location the start row without having an index at an allowed location in the end row (this is very similar to the \"connectivity\" constraint from the ILP problem in Lab 4 of DSCI 512, look back at that and adapt it if you're confused!). Make sure you do NOT setup constraints for every possible pair of start/end indicies, since that would be no better than the provided solution. Note that in this case this solution won't *actually* be faster than `select_best_answer_span_slow` because of the overhead in setting up each PuLP problem (PuLP doesn't support solving the same problem with different inputs, so you need to recreate the problem from scratch each time), but it is still more elegant, and good linear programming practice!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Solve it in regular Python, but using a smarter approach. Instead of searching all possible pairings in a brute force fashion, you should try searching in such a way that you're always checking spans (pairs of start/end indicies) which have high probability. There are number of ways to solve this, one recommended way would be to first use argsort (to get starts/ends which are individually high probability), and then you can apply an algorithm similar to Dijkstra's (DSCI 512 Lecture 8), i.e. keep a list of spans sorted by the sum of the probabilities of their end points, checking them to see if they satisfy your requirements. The tricky part is knowing when and how to add new spans to your sorted list: you should more add spans not only when your list is empty, but also when you can no longer be sure the highest probability span in your list is the highest probability span overall (excluding those you've already checked). But when is that? You obviously can't just add all spans, that would be an $O(n^2)$ solution no better than the provided. If you do this one correctly, it should be quite a bit faster than the provided slow solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can get one bonus point here if you code both kinds of solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you're done, use predictions from your model on the dev set to show that the `select_best_answer_span` you wrote always gives the same result as `select_best_answer_span_slow` (iterate over your batches and use an assert). You can use a max distance of 20 here, and in Exercise 4 (if you are participating in the kaggle competition, you may want to consider this as a hyperparameter to be optimized)."
