You can look at the full corpus [here](https://github.com/budzianowski/multiwoz/tree/master/data/MultiWOZ_2.2). It has an impressively detailed annotation involving multiple turns and multiple goals which we have simplified to just the initiating request (first turn) and involving two possible intents and the corresponding slots for those intents. Download the data from [github](https://github.ubc.ca/jungyeul/labs/raw/master/block6/COLX_563_adv-semantics_lab4.zip), unzip it into a directory outside of your lab repo and change the path below."

    "You will build a system that, when provided with an utterance, predicts the appropriate intent and slots in the format used in the provided answers. This is an open-ended problem and you may solve it however you like, with the following restrictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your solution should include at least one of token-level prediction models used in Labs 1-3 of this course, i.e. you should make use of a CRF, an LSTM, or a BERT model. You may use multiple models.\n",
    "* You may use basic NLP tools (tokenizer, POS, parser) and unsupervised resources such as word embeddings, but you should NOT use an existing NER system, or any additional labeled data for this task.\n",
    "* Your solution should be appropriately decomposed into parts, and documented. This is a complex enough problem that you should have several functions. You may wrap things up into a single class if you like, but you don't have to.\n",
    "* Use the provided assert to test `dev_predicted`, the output of your complete model on the dev set, you will need to pass the assert to get full accuracy points. \n",
    "* Though you may use dev *accuracy* to guide the development of your model, you should not look at either utterances or answers for the dev (or the test) when developing your model. Limit your inspection of the data (e.g. for the purposes of error analysis) to the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You may want to build \"standard\" (non-sequential) ML classifiers for some aspects of this problem, but you don't have to!\n",
    "* You may want to use appropriate lexicons. You can build them yourself, or find some.\n",
    "* Rather than using statistical classifiers, you may want to use rule-based methods to solve some of the problems you're facing.\n",
    "* You should probably do regular error analysis, some kind of crossvalidation in the training set is a good approach for this, or you can create another (inspectable) internal dev set by splitting up the training set.\n",
    "* If you're looking for just a little bit more performance, don't forget to tune your hyperparameters!"
